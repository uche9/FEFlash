                                It's a car that, Bugatti says, was never originally expected to be sold at all.
                                The Bugatti Chiron Profilée was being developed, starting in late 2020, as one of several 
                                versions of the Chiron, Bugattis primary model. Bugatti had always said that only 500 Chirons
                                would ever be made. Included in that 500 have been a few variants, such as the Chiron Sport, 
                                Chiron Pur Sport and Chiron Super Sport, each with varying degrees of top speed, acceleration 
                                and cornering aggressiveness. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Bugatti has also made a few other models, such as the Mistral and Divo, that share engineering
                                with the Chiron but are considered separate models.
                                While the Chiron, with its turbocharged 16-cylinder engine capable of producing 
                                nearly 1,600 horsepower, offered amazing performance, the Pur Sport provided more aggressive 
                                steering and suspension and even quicker acceleration. But some customers were interested in something 
                                that was a mix of the two, offering the Pur Sport's performance but with a mellower style.

                            The early November sun brought to the fore Cape Town’s beautiful ancient cliff 
                            faces with unique contours across the escarpment.The grass punctuating the dark rocks 
                            was drying,  signalling the start of summer.
                            At the heart of the city was a conference shaping Africa’s next digital journey and
                            perhaps how the continent would take care of emerging technological needs.
                            Between November 7 and 14,
                            the world descended on Cape Town, South Africa, for this year’s edition of the AfricaCom

                            there; from showcasing the latest digital and telecom infrastructure to discussing the 
                            future of work, this year’s conference was up to every byte on the money.The annual event, 
                            last held in 2019 because of the ravaging Covid-19 pandemic, centred on the use of
                             technology in homes, offices, and businesses.

                             life on Monday, November 7 with pockets of conferences and presentations in auditoriums.

                             investment, cloud services, data centres, among others.It also focused on connecting

                             “It is the largest live tech event in Africa with visionary speakers and premium

                             the African digital landscape and offer a comprehensive understanding of the region’s
                             communications networking and ICT sector in general.Mr James Williams, the director 
                             of Connecting Africa at InformaTech, says a connected continent can bring several 
                             opportunities to its citizens and the globe in general. Perhaps, the segment more 
                             relevant to most of Africa, and Uganda in particular, was the one on talent, skills 
                             and the future of work in the face of changing technology.

                                    In South Africa, amputee care is a service most cannot afford. Prosthetics 
                                    can cost anything from 20 000 US dollars to 100 000 US dollars. 
                                    Sibongile Mongadi is the founder of Ukuhamba Prosthetics, a small 
                                    business that uses 3D technology to produce low cost prosthetic limbs 
                                    out of recycled materials such as water bottles.

                                    She says her gum infection four years ago led her to start the business.
                                    “I just had a gum infection so my local clinic referred me to my local
                                    hospital and from there I witnessed and saw how our people are struggling 
                                    to access prosthetics. On the very same day, I engaged and tried to put 
                                    myself in an amputee situation where they were not able to access prosthetic 
                                    limbs," said Mongadi
                                      <br/>
                                      <br/>
                                    I thought yes it might not be me but what if it is one of my loved ones? 
                                    We don’t know what the future holds. I asked what’s the problem? The user told me 
                                    that he has been on the waiting list for more than 5 years,” Mongadi added.

                                    While Sibongile has dreams of increasing the production of prosthetics 
                                    from her small facility, activity has been impacted by South Africa’s energy crisis. 
                                    “When we encounter load-shedding, it delays our turnaround time. When a
                                    user comes we used to say that within eight hours we will be able to produce your prosthetic.”
                                    Michael Stevens from Jumping Kids, an organization that supplies and maintains quality
                                    prosthetic equipment for children, believes that while the old way of manufacturing 
                                    technology has worked, the future is towards prosthetics that have high-tech features
                                    such as gyroscopes and accelerometers.

                                    The previous solutions that have been used for the last 30 years, mechanical solutions, 
                                    should be coming down in costs. Prosthetics and amputation have been looked at as
                                    a niche issue and there are a few people who are going to need this. So, therefore
                                    it’s going to get expensive because it doesn’t have scale.” Explain Stevens

                                    According to a McKinsey report, prosthetic innovation will improve global health by 2040. 
                                    Innovative 3D-printed, robotic prosthetic limbs can provide African amputees with an
                                    affordable and high-quality alternative in comparison to conventional prostheses.

                                  The right of freedom of worship must not violate the rights of others, 
                                  the police said in a statement.

                                  Critics say the order violates the constitutional right for freedom of
                                  religion and it is therefore illegal.
                                  Millions of Christians often gather in churches to hear their pastors make 
                                  proclamations about the new year.The messages often range from optimistic 
                                  projections to those warning of impending doom.
                                  The police order came into force last year after the public was inundated by predictions 
                                  of deaths and calamity, local news site My Joy Online reported.In a statement, the police 
                                  commended religious groups for their "cooperation" and for 
                                  "adopting legally acceptable means for communicating prophecies".

                                 No law in Ghana grants the police administration any powers to regulate prophecies in the country," he wrote. "Religious freedom is more than the 'freedom to worship' at a synagogue, church, or mosque. It means people shouldn't have to go against their core values and beliefs in order to conform to culture or government unless it violates a specific law," he added.

                                in the food chain and needed to make better use of science and technology to achieve
                                 a turnaround.

                                into commercial applications and a lack of cooperation between research teams.
                                China has invested large sums of money in basic research for agriculture but

                                    In October, Washington announced some of the broadest export controls yet -

                                  China has filed a complaint against the US with the World Trade Organization
                                   (WTO) over its export controls on semiconductors and other related technology.

                                  This is the first WTO case Beijing has brought against the US since President 
                                  Joe Biden took office in January 2021. In its WTO filing, China alleged that the US is abusing export controls to maintain 
                                  "its leadership in science, technology, engineering and manufacturing sectors".
                                  It added that US actions threatened "the stability of the global industrial supply chains".

                                "BRI is a framework for multi-national economic development. It is providing a window of
                                 opportunity that will bring socio-economic stability for countries around the globe 
                                 including Pakistan," Safdar Ali Shah, director general of CPEC cell at the Higher 
                                 Education Commission of Pakistan, told Xinhua.

                                    <br />
                                With CPEC entering an advanced stage, Shah said the exchanges and cooperation between the
                                two countries in higher education have been reaching a new level over the past few years, adding that further collaboration in higher education is crucial to the building of CPEC and the development of the country.

                                "Pakistan needs to produce young talents that meet the requirements of Chinese companies
                                who want to invest in the country and are in desperate need of skilled people acquainted 
                                with the local conditions and languages ... so there is a need to ramp up educational 
                                cooperation for providing strong intellectual and talent support to Chinese companies," the scholar said.

                                    <br />
                                According to Shah, 18 universities from China and Pakistan established the CPEC Consortium 
                                of Universities back in 2017 to promote academic exchanges for the high-quality development 
                                of CPEC, now the number of member universities has increased to over 110, indicating a 
                                substantial rise in academic and educational exchanges over the years.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                The academic collaboration under the CPEC Consortium of Universities included the establishment
                                of China study centers at various universities across Pakistan, joint research projects, language training and talent cultivation, cultural activities and joint conferences, workshops and exhibitions, he added.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                "The number of Pakistani students learning Chinese language and the number of Chinese students learning Pakistan's national language Urdu have also increased considerably over the years, bringing the people of the two countries closer and closer," he noted.
                                Under the educational cooperation programs between the two neighbors, Shah said thousands of Pakistani students are studying in China, learning Chinese culture, language and majors, adding that most of these students are studying on Chinese scholarships.

                                     <br />
                                  The Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar, has advised the Central Bank of Nigeria to reconsider 
                                  the January 31 deadline for the old notes to remain in circulation in the country.
                                     <br />
                                     <br />
                                  Speaking while receiving the CBN Comptroller in charge of Sokoto State, Dahiru Usman, and some 
                                  officials of the Apex bank on Thursday at his palace, the monarch observed that many people
                                  were still unaware of the redesigned naira notes, especially in the rural areas.

                                  He said, “We still have people who didn’t know that our naira was redesigned. 
                                  They could reject the new naira notes when given. If they see the colours they
                                  will think it is a fake currency.
                                 “The CBN ought to have considered stakeholders right from the day the redesigning was announced.
                                 “We have credible means to disseminate the information to the common man because the conventional
                                  media is for the elites. You should have used traditional rulers to pass the message down to the
                                  masses but you didnt involve us, that is why we keep quite.”
                                     <br />
                                     <br />
                                  He then asked “what will be the fate of these people after January, 31 deadline”?
                                  He also expressed concerns over how the withdrawal limit might affect businesses in the country.
                                  Earlier, the comptroller said that they were in the palace to inform the Sultan about the 
                                  redesigned naira notes and the e-banking as well as seek his advice.
                                     <br />
                                     <br />
                                  He promised to convey Sultan’s advice to the national headquarters.
                                  Meanwhile the officials visited some banks to monitor the compliance to the CBN directive of
                                  dispensing redesigned notes to customers through their ATMs, just as they sensitised 
                                  traders on the need to deposit their money in banks and adopt e-Naira transaction.

                                     ABUJA, Nigeria
                                     <br />
                                     According to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the removal of 
                                     fuel subsidies is one of the fiscal reforms urgently needed to lift Nigeria’s 
                                     development outcomes, which are severely constrained by the inefficient use of resources.
                                     Speaking in this regard, World Bank President, Mr David Malpass, said:  “Nigeria’s
                                     government urgently needs to strengthen fiscal management, create a unified, stable 
                                     market-based exchange rate, phase out its costly, regressive fuel subsidy and rationalize
                                     preferential trade restrictions and tax exemptions.”
                                     <br />
                                     <br />
                                     He spoke while commenting on a World Bank report launched in November last year, 
                                     titled: “Nigeria Public Finance Review: Fiscal Adjustment for Better and Sustained Results,” 
                                     Similarly, the IMF,   in a statement at the end of its Article IV consultation with Nigeria in
                                     November, said: “Directors also urged the removal of untargeted fuel subsidies, with compensatory
                                     measures for the poor and transparent use of saved resources. They stressed the importance of 
                                     further strengthening social safety nets.”
                                     <br />
                                     <br />
                                     Speaking during the interview, the minister noted that the petrol subsidy regime must be exited 
                                     as it is revenue that would have gone into the government coffers.

                                      “Where there is not enough revenue for the government to buy the refined petroleum products, 
                                      we have had to borrow to buy the petroleum products. So, if we take that out, that is about N3.25 trillion. 
                                      That is a significant relief, that we do not incur any more than that number that we projected for in 2023,” she said.
                                      Asked if she felt betrayed that the petrol subsidy had not been removed despite her best 
                                      efforts to ensure removal, she stressed that it was a collective decision to retain the payments.
                                       <br />
                                       <br />
                                      ‘’Betrayed? No. It was a decision that was taken as a collective, recognising the fact that due to 
                                      the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and also heightened inflation, the removal of the fuel 
                                      subsidy at that time, would have increased more burden on the citizens,” Ahmed said.

                                     Flush with success from investing in sports and the arts, Senegal’s cultural capital seems to know
                                     no bounds.
                                     On Dec. 6 2022, Chanel, one of the world’s leading luxury brands, organized a three-day cultural 
                                     program in Senegal, the Chanel Métiers d’Art show. This was the inaugural runway show for the

                                    chose Dakar for its African debut.

                                    fashion event, which took place between the 2nd to 4th of December at the historic island of Gorée.

                                    The 20th-anniversary edition presented the collections of 20 designers from around Africa, 
                                    including widely accoladed names like Mantsho (South Africa), Oumou Sy (Senegal), Karim Tassi

                                      The January 18 draw saw 5,500 Invitations to Apply issued as Immigration, Refugees and

                                      The latest draw showed the impact on the CRS score of conducting two large draws so quickly. 
                                      With a record immigration level of 465,000 for 2023, candidates can expect more such draws and much lower CRS scores.

                                      If more than one candidate had the minimum CRS score, only those who submitted their Express Entry profiles before this date and time received invitations.

                                       along with three new Apple Watch models, an update to its popular AirPods product line and a feature that could save lives when cell service isn’t available.

                                      At a closely-watched event from its headquarters in Cupertino, California, 
                                      Apple showed off four new smartphones, including a larger 6.7-inch iPhone 14 
                                      Plus model and an updated iPhone 14 Pro that rethinks the much-maligned notch.
                                      In typical Apple fashion, the devices also offer better battery life and camera 
                                      features than the year prior.

                                        <br />
                                      The biggest surprise, however, may be the price: The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will start 
                                      at $799 and $899, respectively, the same starting prices as last year’s models. 
                                      The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max start at $999 and $1099, respectively, also unchanged from 
                                      the year prior. Analysts widely predicted Apple would hike the price of the premium models by $100.

                                        <br />
                                      “It is impressive that Apple has maintained year-on-year pricing parity on the new iPhone 14 devices 
                                      in the US,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight. “We had anticipated that inflation,
                                       increased production and component costs, and other expenses such as more expensive shipping would have led
                                       Apple to increase its retail pricing.”

                                        <br />
                                      For Apple, the stakes are always high to convince customers to upgrade devices, and especially the iPhone, 
                                      which remains its central product. That task is potentially made more difficult this year by broader economic
                                       jitters, including fears of a looming recession.

                                      Throughout the event, Apple appeared to alternate between pitching its suite of products as tools for living
                                       our best lives and also for avoiding any number of ills that may befall customers in an uncertain world, ranging from car crashes to getting stranded in the wild.

                                      is designed to support the needs of a rarefied group of outdoor enthusiasts. It also added an option 
                                      for its watches to detect when a user has been in a car crash, as well as a satellite connectivity 
                                      feature for phones, which is intended to help people communicate when their cell service isn’t working.

                                      The new iPhone 14 features a 12 MP main camera with bigger pixels, a faster aperture and improved sensors.
                                       It also uses the same chip as last year’s iPhone 13 Pro model (the A15), the first time it’s repeated a chip in years.

                                      Growth marketing managers, product operations managers, dispensary technicians, technical program managers and sustainability managers are the five fastest-growing jobs in 2023, according to the report published on Wednesday.

                                      It comes at the time that a recent survey showed that almost half of Canadians plan to change their jobs in 2023 due to economic uncertainty and high inflation rates.

                                    It’s a new year, and with the promise of a fresh start comes the inevitable desire to change things up. If you’ve been thinking about chopping off your hair, let this be your sign to officially take the plunge, because we’re expecting bobs to be everywhere in 2023. These easy-to-maintain cuts are extremely versatile and look great with every hair texture and type. Plus, the right style can totally accentuate your natural features. 
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                    To help you determine what style of bob is best for your face shape, we spoke to celebrity hairstylist Ricardo Rojas. Below, he gives his recommendations, plus a few styling tips to keep your hair looking stunning all year long. It goes without saying that you should try out whatever haircut you want, but think of these as ideas to get you started if you haven’t settled on a style yet. 
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                    
                                    <p><b>The Best Bob Styles for Your Face Shape</b></p>
                                        
                                           
                                    <p><b>Square</b></p>
                                        
                                        
                                    If you have a square-shaped face, you’ll want to complement the sharp angles of your face by trying an edgier look. “An angled or asymmetrical bob is a great option for square faces,” says Rojas. Ask your stylist to trim your hair a bit more in the back and keep it longer in the front.

                                      For those with oval-shaped faces, Rojas suggests a lob (a longer bob), below chin length to complement your long, soft features. It’s important to regularly schedule trims for this type of bob, though, so the length doesn’t venture into an awkward territory. “I recommend going no longer than three months between salon visits,” says Rojas. “It has to be trimmed often to keep its shape.”

                                        One of the most popular haircuts of 2022 was the wolf cut, a modern take on the ’70s-inspired shag. You can bring the style into the new year with a trendy shaggy bob. Rojas says this is the perfect look for round faces. “Keep it shorter and add layers for shadows and movement,” he says. When styling at home, add some volume and dimension by using the Ricardo Rojas Full Blown Volumizing Styling Spray.

                                      The African Development Bank(AfDB) has seen countries like Senegal and Mozambique growing their economies ahead of Nigeria in 2023 following revenue from gas investments.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                      The AfDB said, buoyed by revenues and investment related to large natural gas projects, Mozambique and Senegal will rank among Africa’s fastest growing economies.
                                      <br />
                                      <br />
                                      Senegal is projected to see its economy grow 10.2 per cent in 2023 with Mozambique expanding 8 per cent next year.

                                      <br />
                                      However, the bank said, Africa’s two biggest economies, Nigeria and South Africa will remain a drag on continental growth, however, with projections of 3.1 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively for this year.
                                      <br />
                                      <br />
                                      Those growth rates are slightly higher than International Monetary Fund forecasts.
                                      <br />
                                      <br />
                                      Average inflation, meanwhile, which last year hit 13.8 per cent the highest rate in more than a decade, will ease to 8.8 per cent by 2024. But AfDB cautioned that Africa’s expected economic improvement remains fragile.

                                      The President of African Development Bank (AfDB), Akinwunmi Adesina on Thursday called for adequate funding of education sector to reduce youth unemployment in Africa.

                                      Adesina warned that, the high unemployment rate in Africa if not checked could worsen the social and political fragility of countries in the continent.

                                      The AfDB President gave the warning in a lecture delivered at a Colloquium on “The Role of Education in 21st Century Nigeria Development: BBHS Adventure” as part of activities marking the 100 years anniversary of Baptist Boys High School (BBHS), Abeokuta, Ogun State.

                                        Adesina while delivering his lecture virtually said, for the United Nations (UN) goal for inclusive and quality education for all to be achieved, the global spending on education must rise from $1.2 trillion to $3 trillion per year by 2030.
                                        <br />

                                        He said, Nigeria as a nation with rapidly growing population must do more to ensure that the younger generation receive access to the education they deserve.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                        He said, “As a nation, the demands of a dynamic, fast-changing and integrated labour market globally require that we must significantly invest in building first grade and competitive human capital”.
