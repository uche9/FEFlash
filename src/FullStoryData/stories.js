                                It's a car that, Bugatti says, was never originally expected to be sold at all.
                                The Bugatti Chiron Profilée was being developed, starting in late 2020, as one of several 
                                versions of the Chiron, Bugattis primary model. Bugatti had always said that only 500 Chirons
                                would ever be made. Included in that 500 have been a few variants, such as the Chiron Sport, 
                                Chiron Pur Sport and Chiron Super Sport, each with varying degrees of top speed, acceleration 
                                and cornering aggressiveness. 
                                <br />
                                <br />
                                Bugatti has also made a few other models, such as the Mistral and Divo, that share engineering
                                with the Chiron but are considered separate models.
                                While the Chiron, with its turbocharged 16-cylinder engine capable of producing 
                                nearly 1,600 horsepower, offered amazing performance, the Pur Sport provided more aggressive 
                                steering and suspension and even quicker acceleration. But some customers were interested in something 
                                that was a mix of the two, offering the Pur Sport's performance but with a mellower style.

                            The early November sun brought to the fore Cape Town’s beautiful ancient cliff 
                            faces with unique contours across the escarpment.The grass punctuating the dark rocks 
                            was drying,  signalling the start of summer.
                            At the heart of the city was a conference shaping Africa’s next digital journey and
                            perhaps how the continent would take care of emerging technological needs.
                            Between November 7 and 14,
                            the world descended on Cape Town, South Africa, for this year’s edition of the AfricaCom

                            there; from showcasing the latest digital and telecom infrastructure to discussing the 
                            future of work, this year’s conference was up to every byte on the money.The annual event, 
                            last held in 2019 because of the ravaging Covid-19 pandemic, centred on the use of
                             technology in homes, offices, and businesses.

                             life on Monday, November 7 with pockets of conferences and presentations in auditoriums.

                             investment, cloud services, data centres, among others.It also focused on connecting

                             “It is the largest live tech event in Africa with visionary speakers and premium

                             the African digital landscape and offer a comprehensive understanding of the region’s
                             communications networking and ICT sector in general.Mr James Williams, the director 
                             of Connecting Africa at InformaTech, says a connected continent can bring several 
                             opportunities to its citizens and the globe in general. Perhaps, the segment more 
                             relevant to most of Africa, and Uganda in particular, was the one on talent, skills 
                             and the future of work in the face of changing technology.

                                    In South Africa, amputee care is a service most cannot afford. Prosthetics 
                                    can cost anything from 20 000 US dollars to 100 000 US dollars. 
                                    Sibongile Mongadi is the founder of Ukuhamba Prosthetics, a small 
                                    business that uses 3D technology to produce low cost prosthetic limbs 
                                    out of recycled materials such as water bottles.

                                    She says her gum infection four years ago led her to start the business.
                                    “I just had a gum infection so my local clinic referred me to my local
                                    hospital and from there I witnessed and saw how our people are struggling 
                                    to access prosthetics. On the very same day, I engaged and tried to put 
                                    myself in an amputee situation where they were not able to access prosthetic 
                                    limbs," said Mongadi
                                      <br/>
                                      <br/>
                                    I thought yes it might not be me but what if it is one of my loved ones? 
                                    We don’t know what the future holds. I asked what’s the problem? The user told me 
                                    that he has been on the waiting list for more than 5 years,” Mongadi added.

                                    While Sibongile has dreams of increasing the production of prosthetics 
                                    from her small facility, activity has been impacted by South Africa’s energy crisis. 
                                    “When we encounter load-shedding, it delays our turnaround time. When a
                                    user comes we used to say that within eight hours we will be able to produce your prosthetic.”
                                    Michael Stevens from Jumping Kids, an organization that supplies and maintains quality
                                    prosthetic equipment for children, believes that while the old way of manufacturing 
                                    technology has worked, the future is towards prosthetics that have high-tech features
                                    such as gyroscopes and accelerometers.

                                    The previous solutions that have been used for the last 30 years, mechanical solutions, 
                                    should be coming down in costs. Prosthetics and amputation have been looked at as
                                    a niche issue and there are a few people who are going to need this. So, therefore
                                    it’s going to get expensive because it doesn’t have scale.” Explain Stevens

                                    According to a McKinsey report, prosthetic innovation will improve global health by 2040. 
                                    Innovative 3D-printed, robotic prosthetic limbs can provide African amputees with an
                                    affordable and high-quality alternative in comparison to conventional prostheses.

                                  The right of freedom of worship must not violate the rights of others, 
                                  the police said in a statement.

                                  Critics say the order violates the constitutional right for freedom of
                                  religion and it is therefore illegal.
                                  Millions of Christians often gather in churches to hear their pastors make 
                                  proclamations about the new year.The messages often range from optimistic 
                                  projections to those warning of impending doom.
                                  The police order came into force last year after the public was inundated by predictions 
                                  of deaths and calamity, local news site My Joy Online reported.In a statement, the police 
                                  commended religious groups for their "cooperation" and for 
                                  "adopting legally acceptable means for communicating prophecies".

                                 No law in Ghana grants the police administration any powers to regulate prophecies in the country," he wrote. "Religious freedom is more than the 'freedom to worship' at a synagogue, church, or mosque. It means people shouldn't have to go against their core values and beliefs in order to conform to culture or government unless it violates a specific law," he added.

                                in the food chain and needed to make better use of science and technology to achieve
                                 a turnaround.

                                into commercial applications and a lack of cooperation between research teams.
                                China has invested large sums of money in basic research for agriculture but

                                    In October, Washington announced some of the broadest export controls yet -

                                  China has filed a complaint against the US with the World Trade Organization
                                   (WTO) over its export controls on semiconductors and other related technology.

                                  This is the first WTO case Beijing has brought against the US since President 
                                  Joe Biden took office in January 2021. In its WTO filing, China alleged that the US is abusing export controls to maintain 
                                  "its leadership in science, technology, engineering and manufacturing sectors".
                                  It added that US actions threatened "the stability of the global industrial supply chains".

                                "BRI is a framework for multi-national economic development. It is providing a window of
                                 opportunity that will bring socio-economic stability for countries around the globe 
                                 including Pakistan," Safdar Ali Shah, director general of CPEC cell at the Higher 
                                 Education Commission of Pakistan, told Xinhua.

                                    <br />
                                With CPEC entering an advanced stage, Shah said the exchanges and cooperation between the
                                two countries in higher education have been reaching a new level over the past few years, adding that further collaboration in higher education is crucial to the building of CPEC and the development of the country.

                                "Pakistan needs to produce young talents that meet the requirements of Chinese companies
                                who want to invest in the country and are in desperate need of skilled people acquainted 
                                with the local conditions and languages ... so there is a need to ramp up educational 
                                cooperation for providing strong intellectual and talent support to Chinese companies," the scholar said.

                                    <br />
                                According to Shah, 18 universities from China and Pakistan established the CPEC Consortium 
                                of Universities back in 2017 to promote academic exchanges for the high-quality development 
                                of CPEC, now the number of member universities has increased to over 110, indicating a 
                                substantial rise in academic and educational exchanges over the years.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                The academic collaboration under the CPEC Consortium of Universities included the establishment
                                of China study centers at various universities across Pakistan, joint research projects, language training and talent cultivation, cultural activities and joint conferences, workshops and exhibitions, he added.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                "The number of Pakistani students learning Chinese language and the number of Chinese students learning Pakistan's national language Urdu have also increased considerably over the years, bringing the people of the two countries closer and closer," he noted.
                                Under the educational cooperation programs between the two neighbors, Shah said thousands of Pakistani students are studying in China, learning Chinese culture, language and majors, adding that most of these students are studying on Chinese scholarships.

                                     <br />
                                  The Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar, has advised the Central Bank of Nigeria to reconsider 
                                  the January 31 deadline for the old notes to remain in circulation in the country.
                                     <br />
                                     <br />
                                  Speaking while receiving the CBN Comptroller in charge of Sokoto State, Dahiru Usman, and some 
                                  officials of the Apex bank on Thursday at his palace, the monarch observed that many people
                                  were still unaware of the redesigned naira notes, especially in the rural areas.

                                  He said, “We still have people who didn’t know that our naira was redesigned. 
                                  They could reject the new naira notes when given. If they see the colours they
                                  will think it is a fake currency.
                                 “The CBN ought to have considered stakeholders right from the day the redesigning was announced.
                                 “We have credible means to disseminate the information to the common man because the conventional
                                  media is for the elites. You should have used traditional rulers to pass the message down to the
                                  masses but you didnt involve us, that is why we keep quite.”
                                     <br />
                                     <br />
                                  He then asked “what will be the fate of these people after January, 31 deadline”?
                                  He also expressed concerns over how the withdrawal limit might affect businesses in the country.
                                  Earlier, the comptroller said that they were in the palace to inform the Sultan about the 
                                  redesigned naira notes and the e-banking as well as seek his advice.
                                     <br />
                                     <br />
                                  He promised to convey Sultan’s advice to the national headquarters.
                                  Meanwhile the officials visited some banks to monitor the compliance to the CBN directive of
                                  dispensing redesigned notes to customers through their ATMs, just as they sensitised 
                                  traders on the need to deposit their money in banks and adopt e-Naira transaction.

                                     ABUJA, Nigeria
                                     <br />
                                     According to the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, the removal of 
                                     fuel subsidies is one of the fiscal reforms urgently needed to lift Nigeria’s 
                                     development outcomes, which are severely constrained by the inefficient use of resources.
                                     Speaking in this regard, World Bank President, Mr David Malpass, said:  “Nigeria’s
                                     government urgently needs to strengthen fiscal management, create a unified, stable 
                                     market-based exchange rate, phase out its costly, regressive fuel subsidy and rationalize
                                     preferential trade restrictions and tax exemptions.”
                                     <br />
                                     <br />
                                     He spoke while commenting on a World Bank report launched in November last year, 
                                     titled: “Nigeria Public Finance Review: Fiscal Adjustment for Better and Sustained Results,” 
                                     Similarly, the IMF,   in a statement at the end of its Article IV consultation with Nigeria in
                                     November, said: “Directors also urged the removal of untargeted fuel subsidies, with compensatory
                                     measures for the poor and transparent use of saved resources. They stressed the importance of 
                                     further strengthening social safety nets.”
                                     <br />
                                     <br />
                                     Speaking during the interview, the minister noted that the petrol subsidy regime must be exited 
                                     as it is revenue that would have gone into the government coffers.

                                      “Where there is not enough revenue for the government to buy the refined petroleum products, 
                                      we have had to borrow to buy the petroleum products. So, if we take that out, that is about N3.25 trillion. 
                                      That is a significant relief, that we do not incur any more than that number that we projected for in 2023,” she said.
                                      Asked if she felt betrayed that the petrol subsidy had not been removed despite her best 
                                      efforts to ensure removal, she stressed that it was a collective decision to retain the payments.
                                       <br />
                                       <br />
                                      ‘’Betrayed? No. It was a decision that was taken as a collective, recognising the fact that due to 
                                      the lingering impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and also heightened inflation, the removal of the fuel 
                                      subsidy at that time, would have increased more burden on the citizens,” Ahmed said.

                                     Flush with success from investing in sports and the arts, Senegal’s cultural capital seems to know
                                     no bounds.
                                     On Dec. 6 2022, Chanel, one of the world’s leading luxury brands, organized a three-day cultural 
                                     program in Senegal, the Chanel Métiers d’Art show. This was the inaugural runway show for the

                                    chose Dakar for its African debut.

                                    fashion event, which took place between the 2nd to 4th of December at the historic island of Gorée.

                                    The 20th-anniversary edition presented the collections of 20 designers from around Africa, 
                                    including widely accoladed names like Mantsho (South Africa), Oumou Sy (Senegal), Karim Tassi

                                      The January 18 draw saw 5,500 Invitations to Apply issued as Immigration, Refugees and

                                      The latest draw showed the impact on the CRS score of conducting two large draws so quickly. 
                                      With a record immigration level of 465,000 for 2023, candidates can expect more such draws and much lower CRS scores.

                                      If more than one candidate had the minimum CRS score, only those who submitted their Express Entry profiles before this date and time received invitations.

                                       along with three new Apple Watch models, an update to its popular AirPods product line and a feature that could save lives when cell service isn’t available.

                                      At a closely-watched event from its headquarters in Cupertino, California, 
                                      Apple showed off four new smartphones, including a larger 6.7-inch iPhone 14 
                                      Plus model and an updated iPhone 14 Pro that rethinks the much-maligned notch.
                                      In typical Apple fashion, the devices also offer better battery life and camera 
                                      features than the year prior.

                                        <br />
                                      The biggest surprise, however, may be the price: The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus will start 
                                      at $799 and $899, respectively, the same starting prices as last year’s models. 
                                      The iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max start at $999 and $1099, respectively, also unchanged from 
                                      the year prior. Analysts widely predicted Apple would hike the price of the premium models by $100.

                                        <br />
                                      “It is impressive that Apple has maintained year-on-year pricing parity on the new iPhone 14 devices 
                                      in the US,” said Ben Wood, chief analyst at market research firm CCS Insight. “We had anticipated that inflation,
                                       increased production and component costs, and other expenses such as more expensive shipping would have led
                                       Apple to increase its retail pricing.”

                                        <br />
                                      For Apple, the stakes are always high to convince customers to upgrade devices, and especially the iPhone, 
                                      which remains its central product. That task is potentially made more difficult this year by broader economic
                                       jitters, including fears of a looming recession.

                                      Throughout the event, Apple appeared to alternate between pitching its suite of products as tools for living
                                       our best lives and also for avoiding any number of ills that may befall customers in an uncertain world, ranging from car crashes to getting stranded in the wild.

                                      is designed to support the needs of a rarefied group of outdoor enthusiasts. It also added an option 
                                      for its watches to detect when a user has been in a car crash, as well as a satellite connectivity 
                                      feature for phones, which is intended to help people communicate when their cell service isn’t working.

                                      The new iPhone 14 features a 12 MP main camera with bigger pixels, a faster aperture and improved sensors.
                                       It also uses the same chip as last year’s iPhone 13 Pro model (the A15), the first time it’s repeated a chip in years.

                                      Growth marketing managers, product operations managers, dispensary technicians, technical program managers and sustainability managers are the five fastest-growing jobs in 2023, according to the report published on Wednesday.

                                      It comes at the time that a recent survey showed that almost half of Canadians plan to change their jobs in 2023 due to economic uncertainty and high inflation rates.

                                    It’s a new year, and with the promise of a fresh start comes the inevitable desire to change things up. If you’ve been thinking about chopping off your hair, let this be your sign to officially take the plunge, because we’re expecting bobs to be everywhere in 2023. These easy-to-maintain cuts are extremely versatile and look great with every hair texture and type. Plus, the right style can totally accentuate your natural features. 
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                    To help you determine what style of bob is best for your face shape, we spoke to celebrity hairstylist Ricardo Rojas. Below, he gives his recommendations, plus a few styling tips to keep your hair looking stunning all year long. It goes without saying that you should try out whatever haircut you want, but think of these as ideas to get you started if you haven’t settled on a style yet. 
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                    
                                    <p><b>The Best Bob Styles for Your Face Shape</b></p>
                                        
                                           
                                    <p><b>Square</b></p>
                                        
                                        
                                    If you have a square-shaped face, you’ll want to complement the sharp angles of your face by trying an edgier look. “An angled or asymmetrical bob is a great option for square faces,” says Rojas. Ask your stylist to trim your hair a bit more in the back and keep it longer in the front.

                                      For those with oval-shaped faces, Rojas suggests a lob (a longer bob), below chin length to complement your long, soft features. It’s important to regularly schedule trims for this type of bob, though, so the length doesn’t venture into an awkward territory. “I recommend going no longer than three months between salon visits,” says Rojas. “It has to be trimmed often to keep its shape.”

                                        One of the most popular haircuts of 2022 was the wolf cut, a modern take on the ’70s-inspired shag. You can bring the style into the new year with a trendy shaggy bob. Rojas says this is the perfect look for round faces. “Keep it shorter and add layers for shadows and movement,” he says. When styling at home, add some volume and dimension by using the Ricardo Rojas Full Blown Volumizing Styling Spray.

                                      The African Development Bank(AfDB) has seen countries like Senegal and Mozambique growing their economies ahead of Nigeria in 2023 following revenue from gas investments.

                                        <br />
                                      The AfDB said, buoyed by revenues and investment related to large natural gas projects, Mozambique and Senegal will rank among Africa’s fastest growing economies.
                                      <br />
                                      <br />
                                      Senegal is projected to see its economy grow 10.2 per cent in 2023 with Mozambique expanding 8 per cent next year.

                                      However, the bank said, Africa’s two biggest economies, Nigeria and South Africa will remain a drag on continental growth, however, with projections of 3.1 per cent and 1.4 per cent respectively for this year.
                                      <br />
                                      <br />
                                      Those growth rates are slightly higher than International Monetary Fund forecasts.

                                      <br />
                                      Average inflation, meanwhile, which last year hit 13.8 per cent the highest rate in more than a decade, will ease to 8.8 per cent by 2024. But AfDB cautioned that Africa’s expected economic improvement remains fragile.

                                     <b>UNESCO __ </b> has officially recognised Senegal as the origin of Jollof rice, also known as Ceebu jën in Senegal, settling a long-standing debate between West African nations Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal. The dish, which is a staple in West African cuisine, is made of rice and fish, accompanied by vegetables and sometimes tomatoes. 
                                     According to research by The Conversation Africa, the origins of Jollof rice can be traced back to the entrenchment of colonial rule in West Africa between 1860 and 1940. During this period, French colonizers replaced food crops with broken rice imported from Indochina. Over time, broken rice became more prized by the Senegalese than whole rice grain and the dish known as Ceebu jën was born.

                                     <br />
                                     The dish has become a source of pride and cultural identity for the Senegalese and has been recognised as an intangible heritage of humanity by UNESCO. This certification is expected to positively impact the economy, particularly in tourism, agriculture, fishing and catering.
                                     <br />
                                     <br />
                                     In addition to its cultural significance, Jollof rice is also closely linked to a particular way of life and the consumption of the dish is strongly linked to ceremonial events and the aesthetics of presentation and service. The women of Saint Louis, a port city in northern Senegal, are known for their remarkable know-how in this area and have been credited with adding finesse and elegance to the dish.

                                     The Senegalese version of Jollof rice, Ceebu jën, is now officially recognised by UNESCO as an intangible heritage of humanity, putting an end to the ongoing debate over its origins and solidifying Senegal's claim as the true home of Jollof rice.

                                      The announcement comes as a surprise as fans never saw it coming.
                                      Readers will recall that Wizkid postponed the release of his 5th album 'More Love, Less Ego' following the loss of Davido's son. The gesture was applauded by fans who admired the show of respect and support.

                                      <br />
                                      The announcement has sent fans into hysteria as they eagerly look forward to a joint performance from two of Africa's biggest acts.

And with the wider adoption of remote work came more variety in job titles and career levels. While a majority of positions were for experienced-level jobs (62%), manager and senior-level roles claimed 32% of the remote job listings. The remaining 6% of postings were attributed to entry-level jobs.

                                   Countries like America, Qatar, Norway, etc., are on the list of the wealthiest countries in the world, but a small region remains on the top of this list. Gross Domestic Product per capita estimates the economy per person in a country. The most accurate data is expressed through this, but wealth distribution is not shown through GPD. To be at the top of the list, many things are considered, like price structure, per-person income, etc. In a rich country, if you want to rent an apartment, then it will cost 500 dollars per month, but in a poor country, you can rent a palace for the same price.
                                   Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, a small country in Western Europe, is at the top of the list. It is a landlocked country which shares borders with Belgium, Germany and France. Luxembourgish is this country’s national language, but French and German are also used in administrative and Judicial matters. It is one of the smallest countries in Europe, with 2586 square kilometres of area. The population of this country is also very least in Europe. It is a developed country with the world’s top GDP per capita. This country is a founding partner of the European Union, OECD, United Nations and Benelux.

                                    Shortly after Microsoft confirmed plans this week to invest billions in OpenAI, the company behind the viral new AI chatbot tool ChatGPT, some people began joking on social media that the technology would help supercharge the much-hated, wide-eyed, paperclip-shaped virtual assistant.

                                     <br />
                                    While Clippy may mostly be a thing of the past, the company’s move to double down on AI tools offers the promise of doing what Clippy never quite achieved: transforming how we work.

                                     <br />
                                    “There is a kernel of truth to the Clippy comparison,” David Lobina, an artificial intelligence analyst at ABI Research. “Clippy was not based on AI – or machine learning – but ChatGPT is a rather sophisticated auto-completion tool, and in that sense it is a much better version of Clippy.”

                                    Since it was made available in late November, ChatGPT has been used to generate original essays, stories and song lyrics in response to user prompts. It has drafted research paper abstracts that fooled some scientists. Some CEOs have even used it to write emails or do accounting work.

                                    For Microsoft, integrating the chatbot tool could make its core software products more powerful. Some potential use cases include writing lines of text for a PowerPoint presentation, drafting an essay in Word or doing automatic data entry in Excel spreadsheets. For Microsoft’s search engine Bing, ChatGPT could provide more personalized search results and better summarize web pages.

                                    All of the above suggestions were generated by asking ChatGPT various forms of the question, “How could Microsoft integrate ChatGPT into its products?” Microsoft, for is part, has said little on possible integrations beyond recently announcing plans to add ChatGPT features to its cloud computing service.

                                    <b>WASHINGTON , USA __ </b>The U.S. economy likely rolled out of 2022 with momentum, registering decent growth in the face of painful inflation, high interest rates and rising concern that a recession may be months away.

                                      Economists have estimated that the gross domestic product — the broadest measure of economic output — grew at a 2.3% annual pace from October through December, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.
                                      <br />
                                     <br />
                                      The Commerce Department will issue its first of three estimates of fourth-quarter GDP growth at 8:30 a.m. Eastern time Thursday.

                                      Despite a likely second straight quarter of expansion, the economy is widely expected to slow and then slide into a recession sometime in the coming months as increasingly high interest rates, engineered by the Federal Reserve, take a toll. The Fed’s rate hikes have inflated borrowing costs for consumers and businesses, from mortgages to auto loans to corporate credit.
                                      
                                      <br />

                                      The housing market, which is especially vulnerable to higher loan rates, has been badly bruised: Sales of existing homes have dropped for 11 straight months. Investment in housing plunged at a 27% annual rate from July through September.

                                      And consumer spending, which fuels roughly 70% of the entire economy, is likely to soften in the months ahead, along with the still-robust job market. The resilience of the labor market has been a major surprise. Last year, employers added 4.5 million jobs, second only to the 6.7 million that were added in 2021 in government records going back to 1940. And last month’s unemployment rate, 3.5%, matched a 53-year low.

                                     <br />
                                      But the good times for America’s workers aren’t likely to last. As higher rates make borrowing and spending increasingly expensive across the economy, many consumers will spend less and employers will likely hire less.

                                      Last year, the Fed raised its benchmark rate seven times in unusually large increments to try to curb the spike in consumer prices. Yet another Fed rate hike, though a smaller one, is expected next week.

                                      The central bank has been responding to an inflation rate that remains stubbornly high even though it has been gradually easing. Year-over-year inflation was raging at a 9.1% rate in June, the highest level in more than 40 years. It has since cooled — to 6.5% in December — but is still far above the Fed’s 2% annual target.

                            story:<p>
                                    It’s years after the great lockdown – the year of no outing – and one would think we would have gotten enough of Nigerians’ fashion
                                 
                                    Nigerians have always been known for making statements with their fashion, maybe even shaking tables. Whether it’s the skull cap that was revived from the 60s or the palazzo trousers, it’s needless to say they have absolutely hacked this fashion thing.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    Despite half of the country getting married in 2022 and the other half completely engrossed in the World Cup and EPL, fashion statements were still made.

                                    Here are seven fashion trends in Nigeria that topped the grid in 2022, in no specific order:
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                   
                                    <h3>Crochet</h3>: One would have thought crochets were for grannies and new forms but we now have a crochet of every wear for every age group. They come in blouses, beanies, cardigans, skirts, bikinis, shorts, dresses, shoes.
                                    <p className='container--image--item'>
                                                <img className='image--item' 
                                                    src={require(`../images/image31/image31_2.png`)} style={{margin:'20px', width:'100%', aspectRatio:'2' }}  alt='headline_photo' 
                                                  />
                                          </p>
                                    With the comfortable and easy to wash material, there is something for everyone. There are bikinis, crop blouses, short skirts etc for the dry season and beanies, cardigans for the rainy season.
                                    
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                    <h3>Crocs</h3>: This crocodile-like fancy footwear has become popular. Crocs has grown from just another footwear that topped the charts, into a movement. This growth isn’t completely surprising; it’s a unicorn footwear giving comfort, confidence and cool energy.
                                          <p className='container--image--item'>
                                                <img className='image--item' 
                                                    src={require(`../images/image31/image31_1.png`)} style={{margin:'20px', width:'100%', aspectRatio:'2' }}  alt='headline_photo' 
                                                  />
                                          </p>
                                  Either the popular beauty ambassador, Enioluwa Adeoluwa changed the Crocs game in Nigeria with the ambassadorship deal or Crocs changed his; it is evident that something changed for both in 2022.

                                  <b>Philipines __</b>
                                  The Philippines has recorded its strongest economic growth in more than 40 years, defying a global slowdown and rising inflation after lifting all pandemic restrictions at the end of last year.
                                    <br />
                                    <br />
                                  The south-east Asian economy grew at an annual rate of 7.2 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2022, beating economist expectations of about 6.5 per cent growth, according to Philippine Statistics Authority data. Full-year gross domestic product increased by 7.6 per cent, its strongest growth since 1976.
                                  <br />
                                    <br />
                                  The Philippines, which relies largely on remittances from overseas workers and business outsourcing activities such as call centres, alongside farming and fishing, suffered one of Asia’s sharpest contractions during the pandemic because of strict lockdowns.
                                  <br />
                                    <br />
                                  The government on Thursday attributed much of the growth to the country’s reopening in the final three months of the year, with the services industry, consumer and government spending, exports and imports all posting strong rises.
                                  <br />
                                    <br />
                                  Economic planning secretary Arsenio Balisacan forecasted a further boost to the economy this year from the end of zero-Covid in China, saying it would “surely be a boon”.
                                  <br />
                                    <br />
                                  The upbeat outlook of the Philippines and many of its regional emerging market neighbours including Indonesia and Malaysia contrasts sharply with that of developed nations.
                                  <br />
                                    <br />
                                  Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos Jr, who attended the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, predicted the economy would keep growing at near 7 per cent this year.
	                                US and European central bankers speaking at the conference instead vowed to “stay the course” on interest rate increases to cool down their economies and tame high inflation.
                                  <br />
                                    <br />
                                  John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said he expected growth to slow to a “modest” pace of roughly 1 per cent in 2023, while Christine Lagarde, head of the European Central Bank, projected growth of 0.5 per cent.
                                  <br />
                                    <br />
                                  However, analysts cautioned the Philippines economy could be hit by inflation even as they revised up growth forecasts. “High inflation — the headline rate reached 8.1 per cent year on year in December — will drag on the purchasing power of consumers,” research company Capital Economics said in a note.

                                      India has showcased its military might and cultural heritage in a colourful parade at a revamped ceremonial boulevard in New Delhi to mark Republic Day, the anniversary of the day the country’s constitution came into effect in 1950.
                                       <br />
                                       <br />
                                      Tens of thousands of people endured a winter chill and mist on Thursday as they gathered to watch the parade, where Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi was a guest of honour.

                                      A 144-member band and marching contingent from the Egyptian Armed Forces also joined battalions of the Indian military and police in the parade.

                                       <br />
                                      El-Sisi, in a blue suit and matching tie, was flanked by Indian President Droupadi Murmu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who wore a saffron-and-yellow–coloured turban.
                                      <br />
                                       <br />
                                      Many women, men, schoolchildren and folk dancers in colourful dresses performed cultural and fusion dances down the boulevard amid big cheers from the crowd.

                                      Howitzer guns, tanks, supersonic cruise missiles, anti-tank missiles and armoured personnel carriers were displayed at the parade, with hundreds of men from police and military battalions marching along. Stunt performers on motorbikes also joined from the presidential palace.

                                    <br />
                                    Kylie Jenner, one of the world’s most followed celebrities on Instagram, arrived at the Schiaparelli show, which opened the Couture Fashion Week, wearing a strapless black velvet gown. But more than anything else, it was the faux lion head affixed to the dress that went viral on social media.
                                     <br />
                                     <br />
                                  The dress she wore is one of the looks from the new collection and hadn’t even hit the runway when Jenner wore it.
                                  <br />
                                     <br />
                                  “BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. thank you @danielroseberry and @schiaparelli for such a special morning. wow i loved wearing this faux art creation constructed by hand using manmade materials,” wrote Jenner on Instagram while sharing photos of herself in the dress.
                                  <br />
                                     <br />
                                  Schiaparelli creative director Daniel Roseberry said that his collection was inspired by Dante’s Inferno.
                                  <br />
                                     <br />
                                  The foam animal heads on the dresses that were presented were of a lion, a leopard and a she-wolf. According to Roseberry, they represented “lust, pride and avarice.”
                                  <br />
                                     <br />
                                  Irina Shayk modelled the lion-head dress on the runway while Naomi Campbell walked in the she-wolf style on an all-black coat.

                                        Novak Djokovic spoke, after brushing aside Andrey Rublev, of a desire to send a message to his remaining rivals. Although his formidable record at the Australian Open means it is scarcely needed with the Serbian aiming for an historic 10th title and a return to world No 1

                                        Concerns over a hamstring injury appear to have receded, and a desire to stay on the front foot and avoid too much running has led to Djokovic crushing Alex De Minaur and Andrey Rublev in back-to-back matches for the loss of just 12 games in six sets.

                                    A number of global tech giants are among the best places to work at in Australia, according to a new report.

                                    The Top Employers Institute has revealed its top ranking workplaces for 2023, with five tech companies scoring a place among the top companies in Australia.

                                    The Institute’s program certifies companies based on the participation and results of their Human Resources Best Practices Survey, which covers six human resources domains and 20 topics including people strategy, work environment, talent acquisition, learning, diversity and inclusion, and wellbeing.

                                    The top five tech companies to work for in Australia are:

                                    The companies recognised as top employers performed particularly well during the pandemic and looked after their employees, Top Employers Institute CEO David Plink explained.
                                      
                                    “Exceptional times bring out the best in people and organisations,” he said.

                                    “And we have witnessed this in our Top Employers Certification program this year: an exceptional performance from the certified Top Employers 2023.”

                                    The 2023 iteration of the report acknowledges some of the companies that cared for their employees effectively during the pandemic and have maintained many of the same practices in recent months.

                                    The Top Employers Institute has now certified more than 2,000 companies across more than 120 countries.

                                    To be recognised, a company must first be evaluated against the organisation’s entry criteria. Once approved, the company takes part in the survey and is judged based on its people practices.

                                    The survey covers six HR domains: steer, shape, attract, develop, engage and unit.

                                    To be eligible, a company must have at least 250 local or 2,500 international employees, and advanced and formal human resources practices.

                                    HCLTech is a global tech firm employing nearly 220,000 people across 54 countries, and with offices in Adelaide, Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney. The company assists other businesses with digital transformation, having capabilities across digital, engineering and cloud.

                                    Included in its HR-focused policies is the employee-driven initiative TechBee.

                                    This early-career program helps to train the next generation of tech workers, and is aimed at trying to attract workers with a non-tech background to reskill into the sector.

                                    The company was named as a Top Employer in the Asia-Pacific, Europe, North America and globally.

                                    HCLTech executive vice president and country manager Australia and New Zealand Michael Horton said being a top employer is all about putting the workers first.

                                    “Our employees are at the heart of our business, and by putting them first, we’ve fostered a community where employees can grow as individuals and work as a collective,” Horton said.

                                         If you want a hint at the pace of China’s economic rebound and how it might lift Australia’s economy, look to the skies, says one seasoned Chinese-Australian businessman.
                                         <br />
                                         <br />
                                        Watch in particular for the expansion of flights between the two nations, especially those run by China Eastern Airlines from Shanghai, China’s financial powerhouse.
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        “Of China’s ‘gold collar’ people – or high net worth individuals – 80% are from Shanghai,” said the businessman, who requested anonymity given his extensive links to Chinese firms in Australia. “That’s a signal. If China Eastern is not operating many flights, that means trouble.”
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        The early signs are promising. China Eastern had cut its pre-Covid schedule of 10 weekly flights from Shanghai to Sydney to as few as one, while its 10 runs to Melbourne were suspended entirely – but from 1 February, the Sydney to Shanghai route will be daily, a spokesperson said.
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        China’s economy, the world’s second largest, is critical for Australia’s fortunes and those of many of its neighbours. China buys about a third of Australia’s exports, equal to those shipped to Japan, South Korea, the US and India combined.
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        When China reported this week annual GDP growth had slowed to 3% in 2022, its second-worst result since the mid-1970s, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, declared the slowdown “one of the major economic challenges facing Australia at the start of 2023”.
                                        <br />
                                         <br />
                                        “The global economy is a volatile place right now and developments in China are a big part of that,” Chalmers said.

                                      The Bank of Canada has raised its benchmark interest rate again, to 4.5 per cent.
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      The move was widely expected by economists as the bank tries to wrestle record-high inflation into submission.
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      It's the eighth time in less than a year that the bank has hiked its trendsetting rate — a move that will make borrowing money more expensive.
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      But at one quarter of a percentage point, it's also the smallest hike since March, and thus a sign that the bank may be done with hiking rates for the next little while. 
                                      The bank said as much at a news conference following the announcement, with governor Tiff Macklem using the word "pause" to describe the bank's monetary policy strategy at this moment.
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      "With today's modest increase, we expect to pause rate hikes while we assess the impacts of the substantial monetary policy tightening already undertaken," he said. "To be clear, this is a conditional pause — it is conditional on economic developments evolving broadly in line with our … outlook.
                                         <br />
                                         <br />
                                      "If we need to do more to get inflation to the two-per-cent target, we will."

                                       In a world full of more technology than ever before, and as the tech evolves, the need for humans to be involved is becoming less and less.
                                       <br />
                                         <br />
                                       Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Twitter, Spotify and more big tech companies have all been making major cuts to its workforce.
                                       One of the reasons for the layoffs is due to the major hiring sessions many companies had over the COVID-19 pandemic. With a higher demand for technology, companies were able to take on more workers.
                                       <br />
                                         <br />
                                      Now that people are generally back to their ‘normal lives’, there is less of a need for workers.
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      Aaron Genest, SaskTech president, argues there is another reason people are being laid off.
                                      “Most companies feel that there’s a looming recession,” Genest said. “How big, how deep how long does it last? We don’t know but we’re all positioning for it one way or another.”
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      For Saskatchewan tech companies however, Genest feels it’s a different story.
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      “We’re not the kind of companies that have scaled rapidly to meet the changes over the last few years, so we’re not seeing people shed the jobs in the same way,” he explained.
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      According to 2018 data, the tech sector in Saskatchewan spanned roughly 5,000 companies at the time.

                                         <br />
                                      Those companies, however, contributed nearly $5 billion to the provinces gross domestic product that year.
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      In 2023, many Saskatchewan tech companies feel there is still room to grow.
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      “I think we see it as an opportunity,” said Jordan McFarlen, the incubator manager for Saskatchewan tech company Cultivator.
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      “No doubt there will be challenges given the whole global economic scenario. But I think it’s a very opportunistic scenario for early-stage Sask. companies.”
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      While there any many jobs needed in the tech world, McFarlen believes there is still one everyone is searching for.
                                      <br />
                                         <br />
                                      “People in those software engineer developer roles are still in high demand,” he said.

                                      <b>Tanzania</b>
                                      The government of Tanzania very recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with a United Arab Emirates (UAE) firm for the construction of petroleum receiving and storage infrastructures. 
                                      <br />
                                      <br />
                                      This deal was brokered yesterday between the Tanzanian Ministry of Energy and representatives of the Emirates National Oil Company Group (ENOC).
                                      <br />
                                      <br />
                                      During the signing, the minister for Energy, Mr January Makamba, noted that one of the major issues that would be addressed by the commissioning of this project is the long waiting time for offloading of oil products, especially on transit to other East African countries. He mentioned that shipping delay could persist more than 2 weeks, which often triggers an increase in the product’s price.
                                      <br />
                                      <br />
                                      “The current Petroleum Act requires the country to have enough petrol for utilization for 15 days, but currently the storage enables us to sustain for 30 consecutive days. Much should be done to increase the country’s storage capacity,” the minister said.
                                      <br />
                                      <br />
                                      The minister also made mention of how the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine is affecting the energy market, and noted that now is as good a time as any to embark on such a project. 
                                      Commenting on the project, the chief executive officer of the ENOC Group, Mr Saif Humaid Al promised to work closely with the Tanzanian government to mitigate some of the challenges facing the country’s energy sector.
                                      <br />
                                      <br />
                                      “The current infrastructure will help us in the estimation and negotiation processes with the government. We have the experience to carry such projects to other countries like Morocco, Djibouti, Malaysia, and Dubai,” he said.
                                      <br />
                                      <br />
                                      So far in the first month of the new year, a number of oil deals have been successfully negotiated between African countries and foreign oil firms. Countries such as Algeria, Libya, and Uganda have made major strides in their oil sector based on these new deals.

                                  A regional coalition of pro-democracy civil society organisations has said Nigeria’s general elections have implications for similar polls taking place in two West African countries within the year. The two other West African countries are Sierra Leone and Liberia.
                                  <br />
                                   <br />
                                  The West Africa Democracy Solidarity Network (WADEMOS) said this on Friday during its four-day official visit to Nigeria. The coalition highlighted areas the country needed to improve on to achieve credible polls.

                                  Addressing journalists in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, on Friday, the leader of the WADEMOS delegation, Kojo Asante, said the Nigerian election “is particularly important for the entire sub-region as it sets the tone for subsequent elections in Sierra Leone (June 2023) and Liberia (October 2023).”

                                  This, according to Mr Asante, necessitated the need to solidarize with civil society, especially the WADEMOS members in Nigeria, assess the level of preparedness of key electoral stakeholders towards the elections, and offer recommendations to key stakeholders for redress on challenges identified.

                                    He also gave additional seven days to enable Nigerians to deposit their old naira notes after it ceases to be legal tender on February 10.

                                    The PUNCH reported that the CBN had earlier fixed January 31 as the deadline for the exchange of old N1,000, N500 and N200 notes.

                                    Before extending the deadline, the apex bank had refused to shift grounds despite coming under severe criticisms and significant pressure from the National Assembly, politicians, banks, customers, and key stakeholders.
                                    The CBN governor had also failed to appear before the House four times, prompting the Speaker of the House of Representatives, Femi Gbajabiamila, Tuesday, to declare his readiness to issue a warrant of arrest against him if he fails to appear before its committee last Thursday.

                                    Gbajabiamila said the lawmakers would reconvene on Tuesday (tomorrow) to take an action against Emefiele and other bank chiefs who failed to honour the house’s summons.

                                    In his statement, however, the CBN governor stressed that the currency redesign programme was necessary to enable more efficient monetary policy decisions alongside curtailing banditry and ransom-taking.

                                     <br />
                                    Emefiele said that for 19 years, the CBN hadn’t re-design the naira, whereas, he said, this should normally have been done within a five to eight years window.
                                    <br />
                                     <br />
                                    Enumerating the merits and benefits of the re-design, Emefiele said, “Our aim is mainly to make our Monetary Policy Decisions more efficacious and like you can see; we’ve started to see inflation trending downwards and exchange rates relatively stable.
                                    <br />
                                     <br />
                                    ‘’Secondly, we aim to support the efforts of our Security agencies in combating banditry and ransom-taking in Nigeria through this program and we can see that the military is making good progress in this important task in Nigeria.”

                                   Stanbic IBTC Trustees Limited, through the Stanbic IBTC Education Trust (SET), has made assisting Nigerian parents and guardians secure their children and wards’ academic future one of its top priorities.
                                   SET is a flexible and easy investment plan with long-term benefits that support parents and guardians striving to provide quality education for their children and wards.

                                     <br />
                                   Speaking about the positive impact of SET on the Nigerian child, Mr. Charles Omoera, Chief Executive, Stanbic IBTC Trustees Limited, said the organisation understands the significant impact of quality education on every child and the positive effect it will have in shaping their future. 
                                   Omoera urged parents and guardians to put in place SET for their children and wards, to help them address any adverse circumstances likely to halt their education.
                                   <br />
                                     <br />
                                   He stated that parents and guardians must always strive to give their children and wards quality education, to position them for rare opportunities attached to the benefits of having quality education.
                                   <br />
                                     <br />
                                   With SET, parents and guardians can ensure the payment of their children and wards’ school fees, as education related expenses are directly made to the institutions of learning, from elementary to tertiary levels. 
                                   This action ensures that unforeseeable events do not cause a disruption in their education, which may negatively impact their future. Education trust funds are invested in conservative type instruments and professionally managed and administered by a reputable Corporate Trustee and Fund Manager.

                                     <br />
                                   Parents and guardians can also nominate their children and wards’ SET accounts as beneficiary for their life insurance policies. A clear example is the Group Life Insurance Policy. Situations like this would ensure that the portion allocated to each child’s SET account is received and utilised for the child’s education. This has proven to be extremely beneficial if the child is a minor (under 18 years of age) or still in school.

                                   When it comes to launching a startup, most founders think they should reside in the United States, Silicon Valley, in particular, to have a successful business. While being in Silicon Valley provides excellent access to key people and companies, its fierce competition and fast-paced environment can soon kill the dreams of having a startup.
                                   <br />
                                     <br />
                                   But there are other regions in the world that might not be as fancy as Silicon Valley but have a remarkable potential for growth. Southeast Asia is one of them.
                                   The region consists of 11 countries. It is home to over 680 million people and over 400 million internet users- nearly 70% of the population.
                                   <br />
                                     <br />
                                  As per a report by Google, Temasek Holdings, and Bain & Company, as many as 40 million people in six countries across the region — Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Vietnam, and Thailand — came online for the first time in 2020. The report predicts that the region’s internet economy can cross $300 billion by 2025.
                                  <br />
                                     <br />
                                  As the region was preparing for a new economic boom phase, the Covid-19 pandemic arrived. Southeast Asia was walloped by Covid-19. Hundreds of thousands of people died, and millions were affected. According to Asian Development Bank, Covid-19 pushed 4.7 million people into extreme poverty across Southeast Asia and removed 9.3 million jobs in the region.
                                  The region’s economy is recovering and adjusting to the new normal. If you leave aside the devastating impacts of Covid-19 on the economy and people, this pandemic was able to change the prospects of startups in Southeast Asia.

                                     <br />
                                  Even before the pandemic began, Southeast Asia startups were thriving and could collect large checks from investors. According to Jungle Ventures, Southeast Asia’s technology startups had a combined valuation of $340 billion in 2020. This amount can triple by 2025. Also, Southeast Asia’s startups raised a record $6 billion in the first quarter of 2021.

                                     <br />
                                  Venture capital (VC) investment is the primary funding source for regional startups. In 2010, the VC investment in Southeast Asia startups was just $100 million. However, this amount could reach $9.6 billion in 2018. The number is growing year by year.

                                  <h3>The pandemic has significantly increased the demand for access to digital services.</h3>

                                  The Pandemic expansion and lockdowns led to skyrocketing usage of digital services and the creation of new startups. For example, Yahoo reports that Vietnam has added 8 million new digital consumers, with 55% of them coming from non-metro areas between the start of the pandemic and the first half of 2021.

                                  Also, between the start of the pandemic and up till the first half of 2021, Indonesia could add 21 million new digital consumers, of which 72% are from non-metro areas.

                            story:<p>
                                  Over the course of 2018, during a research period in the small southern African kingdom of Eswatini, I made multiple phone calls. My question was always the same: had the person heard of someone called Regina Twala?

                                  Twala had been a writer, intellectual and anti-colonial political activist of the 1950s and 60s. She was born in South Africa, but after her arrest in 1952 for participating in the non-violent resistance movement the Defiance Campaign, she found the country increasingly repressive. In 1954, like many other Black activists she chose to cross the border to Eswatini, formerly Swaziland, to live in exile, and died there in 1968 at 60. She was the second Black woman to obtain a degree from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg and was one of the co-founders of the Swaziland Progressive Party, Eswatini’s first political party, in 1960.

                                  Yet no one I phoned had heard of Twala. I was surprised. From the little I knew of her, Twala had clearly been an influential figure. And Eswatini – where I was raised and educated – is a small country, about the size of New Jersey. It’s hard to remain anonymous there.

                                      How could I make sense of the fact that a significant woman of her era could be virtually erased from popular history and memory? At the heart of the mystery stood another intellectual – a celebrated European historian called Bengt Sundkler. As I would learn, Sundkler’s fame existed in direct reciprocity with Twala’s obscurity.
                                        <br />
                                        <br />
                                      In 1976, Sundkler published a book on religion in Africa, called Zulu Zion. It would become a celebrated reference point for all interested in how Christianity in Africa expressed itself via existing indigenous religious beliefs.
                                      <br />
                                        <br />
                                      Unable to travel to southern Africa due to his heavy teaching obligations at Uppsala university in Sweden, Sundkler hired Twala as his research assistant, paying her to undertake an investigation of African churches throughout the 1950s. The Uppsala archives contain dozens of pages of research material sent by Twala to Sundkler on this topic. Consider this paragraph, where Twala describes how a group of church women danced with flags and sticks to the royal palace (Lobamba) of the king of Swaziland, Sobhuza II:
                                      <br />
                                        <br />
                                          <i>''A bell was rung, and that was a signal for all to find their staves and set out for Lobamba [Sobhuza’s palace], then when the women began singing the congregation began marching in circles. The women with flags, emagosa, always led the way. This parade before the Church House is called kuhlehla, same term as used for warriors or age-groups when they dance or give a display before royalty."</i>
                                          <br />
                                        <br />
                                      Imagine my astonishment when I discovered a strikingly similar passage published in Sundkler’s Zulu Zion. Sundkler passed these words off as his own but they were lifted near-directly from the material Twala had sent him 20 years earlier:
                                 
                                 </p>

                            story:<p>
                                     VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is opening a six-day visit to Congo and South Sudan on Tuesday, aiming to bring a message of peace to two countries riven by poverty, conflict and what Francis has called a lingering “colonialist mentality” that still considers Africa ripe for exploitation.
                                     <br />
                                        <br />
                                    Aid groups are hoping Francis’ trip will shine a spotlight on two of the world’s forgotten conflicts and rekindle international attention on some of Africa’s worst humanitarian crises, amid donor fatigue and new aid priorities in Ukraine.
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                    But Francis’ trip will also bring him face-to-face with the future of the Catholic Church: Africa is one of the only places in the world where the Catholic flock is growing, in terms of practicing faithful as well as fresh vocations to the priesthood and religious life.
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                    That makes his trip, his fifth to the African continent in his 10-year pontificate, all the more important as Francis seeks to make his mark on reshaping the church as a “field hospital for wounded souls” where all are welcome and poor people have a special pride of place.
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                    “Yes, Africa is in turmoil and is also suffering from the invasion of exploiters,” Francis told The Associated Press in an interview last week. But he said the church can also learn from the continent and its people.
                                    “We need to listen to their culture: dialogue, learn, talk, promote,” Francis said, suggesting that his message would differ from the scolding tone St. John Paul II used in 1980 and 1985 when he reminded Congolese priests and bishops of the need to stick to their celibacy vows.
                                    <br />
                                        <br />
                                    Congo, Francis’ first stop, stands out as the African country with most Catholics hands down: Half of its 105 million people are Catholic, the country counts more than 6,000 priests, 10,000 nuns and more than 4,000 seminarians — 3.6% of the global total of young men studying for the priesthood.

                                    Congolese faithful were flocking to Kinshasa for Francis’ main event, a Mass on Wednesday at Ndolo airport that is expected to draw as many as 2 million people in one of the biggest gatherings of its kind in Congo and one of Francis’ biggest Masses ever.

                                    Since we launched the previous edition of Foresight Africa in January 2022, our world has changed remarkably. Russia invaded Ukraine—an unanticipated event that roiled the global economy and sent food, fuel, and fertilizer prices sky high. Sanctions on Russia resulted in trade and logistical bottlenecks, which added more pressure on already strained supply chains. The U.S. Federal Reserve and other major central banks’ unrelenting efforts to tame inflation ushered in a new era of high interest rates and aggravated several countries’ ability to settle their international financial obligations. Meanwhile, the uneven recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic continued to feature in headlines across Africa and elsewhere. The combination of fragility in parts of the African continent and adverse weather conditions dampened economic growth in the region in 2022.

                                    With these external and internal headwinds, it is easy to be pessimistic about Africa’s prospects. Yet, time and time again—as we have seen in the case of the Ebola crisis, HIV/AIDS crisis, and now the COVID-19 pandemic—Africa has proved resilient. We must be conscious of the danger of a single story—especially as many African countries will continue to fare well, despite the odds. Indeed, even though the region is unlikely to be fully out of the woods in 2023, the Economist Intelligence Unit forecasts overall growth of

                                    3.2 percent. Medium-sized economies, such as Senegal, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Kenya, will drive much of this growth—with predicted growth rates of 5 to 7 percent in the year ahead. On the other hand, the region’s economic powerhouses (South Africa, Nigeria, and Egypt) are expected to record slower growth.

                                    Despite these obstacles, I open this year’s edition on an optimistic note, bearing in mind Africa’s resilience and demonstrated capacity to weather severe headwinds. This optimism is buoyed by several factors: an enhanced collaboration that culminated in operationalization of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA); the coming together of African institutions (the African Union, Africa CDC, United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, African Export-Import Bank, and others) to secure funding for vaccines; and the region’s rapid adoption of technological innovations to address practical problems—as evidenced by the innovative digital services that boomed during the pandemic.
